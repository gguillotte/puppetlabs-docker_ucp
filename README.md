## Description

The [Docker Universal Control
Plane](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-universal-control-plane) (UCP)
module installs and configures a UCP controller, and joins nodes to it.

This module provides a single class, `docker_ucp`, which uses the
official [`docker/ucp` container](https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/ucp/) to
bootstrap a UCP controller or join a node to an existing UCP-managed swarm.

## Setup

The module depends on Docker. To install and configure Docker with Puppet, use
the [`garethr/docker` module](https://forge.puppet.com/garethr/docker).

Review the
[UCP system requirements](https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.1/guides/admin/install/system-requirements/)
before installing a UCP controller on a node, and
[plan your UCP installation](https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.1/guides/admin/install/plan-installation/)
before deploying UCP in a production environment.

### Beginning with docker_ucp

The `docker_ucp` class has two modes of operation: to install and configure a
UCP controller on a node, and to join a node to a UCP-managed swarm.

#### Installing a controller

To install a UCP controller with the default `admin/orca` username and password,
add the `docker_ucp` class with the `controller` parameter set to true.

```puppet
class { 'docker_ucp':
  controller => true,
}
```

Once the controller is installed and available, log into it and change the admin user
password.

#### Joining a node

You can also use the `docker_ucp` class to join a node to a UCP-managed swarm.
The required class parameters depend on your UCP version. See
[Joining a node to a UCP-managed swarm](#joining-a-node-to-a-UCP-managed-swarm)
for examples.

## Usage

The parameters available to the docker_ucp class depend on your configuration. Consult the
[UCP CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.2/reference/cli/install/) for
details about these options.

```puppet
class { 'docker_ucp':
  controller                => true,
  host_address              => ::ipaddress_eth1,
  version                   => '1.0.0',
  usage                     => false,
  tracking                  => false,
  subject_alternative_names => ::ipaddress_eth1,
  external_ca               => false,
  swarm_scheduler           => 'binpack',
  swarm_port                => 19001,
  controller_port           => 19002,
  preserve_certs            => true,
  docker_socket_path        => '/var/run/docker.sock',
  license_file              => '/etc/docker/subscription.lic',
}
```

> **NOTE:** The `license_file` parameter requires UCP version 0.8.0 or newer.

### Joining a node to a UCP-managed swarm

#### Version =< 1

```puppet
class { 'docker_ucp':
  ucp_url     => 'https://ucp-controller.example.com',
  fingerprint => 'the-ucp-fingerprint-for-your-install',
}
```

The module uses the default username (`admin`) and password (`orca`). To set these,
provide those in parameters.

The class also takes other parameters useful for joining a node to a swarm. These should
also correspond with the options described in the official UCP documetation.

```puppet
class { 'docker_ucp':
  ucp_url                   => 'https://ucp-controller.example.com',
  fingerprint               => 'the-ucp-fingerprint-for-your-install',
  username                  => 'admin',
  password                  => 'orca',
  host_address              => ::ipaddress_eth1,
  subject_alternative_names => ::ipaddress_eth1,
  replica                   => true,
  version                   => '0.8.0',
  usage                     => false,
  tracking                  => false,
}
```

#### Version 2 and newer

In UCP version 2, Docker changed the underlying cluster scheduler from Swarm legacy to
Swarm mode, which also changed the join flags.

To join a node to a v2 manager (known as a controller in UCP v1):

```puppet
class { 'docker_ucp':
  version           => '2.1.0',
  token             => 'Your join token here',
  listen_address    => '192.168.1.2',
  advertise_address => '192.168.1.2',
  ucp_manager       => '192.168.1.1',
}
```

### Installing a Docker Trusted Registry

[Docker trusted registry](https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/dtr/2.2/guides/)
(DTR) is a containerized Docker image storage application that runs on a Docker UCP
cluster.

To install a DTR in a UCP cluster using the docker_ucp module, use the module's `dtr`
defined type.

```puppet
docker_ucp::dtr { 'Dtr install':
  install          => true,
  dtr_version      => 'latest',
  dtr_external_url => 'https://172.17.10.104',
  ucp_node         => 'ucp-04',
  ucp_username     => 'admin',
  ucp_password     => 'orca4307',
  ucp_insecure_tls => true,
  dtr_ucp_url      => 'https://172.17.10.101',
  require          => [ Class['docker_ucp']
}
```

In this example, we:

-   Set `install => true`, which configures a new registry.
-   Set `dtr_version`, which can be any version of the registry compatible with the UCP
    cluster.
-   Set `dtr_external_url` to the URL where the registry can be accessed.
-   Set `ucp_node`Â to the name of the node in the cluster where the registry will run.
-   Set the `ucp_username` and `ucp_password`.
-   Set `ucp_insecure_tls => true` to allow self-signed SSL certificates. In production,
    set this to false and use properly signed certificates.
-   Set `dtr_ucp_url` to the URL that the registry uses to contact the UCP cluster.

#### Joining a replica to a Docker Trusted Registry cluster

To
[join a replica](https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/dtr/2.2/guides/admin/install/#step-5-configure-dtr#step-7-join-replicas-to-the-cluster)
to a DTR cluster, use `join => true` instead of `install => true`.

```puppet
docker_ucp::dtr { 'Dtr install':
  join             => true,
  dtr_version      => 'latest',
  ucp_node         => 'ucp-03',
  ucp_username     => 'admin',
  ucp_password     => 'orca4307',
  ucp_insecure_tls => true,
  dtr_ucp_url      => 'https://172.17.10.101',
  require          => [ Class['docker_ucp']
}
```

Also, note that the replica doesn't use `dtr_external_url`.

> **NOTE:** You can't use the `install` and `join` parameters in the same declaration of
> a dtr defined type.

#### Removing a Docker Trusted Registry

To remove the DTR from your UCP cluster, provide the same parameters as in
[installation](#installing-a-docker-trusted-registry), but use `ensure => 'absent'`
instead of `install => true`.

```puppet
docker_ucp::dtr { 'Dtr install':
  ensure           => 'absent',
  dtr_version      => 'latest',
  dtr_external_url => 'https://172.17.10.104',
  ucp_node         => 'ucp-04',
  ucp_username     => 'admin',
  ucp_password     => 'orca4307',
  ucp_insecure_tls => true,
  dtr_ucp_url      => 'https://172.17.10.101',
}
```
